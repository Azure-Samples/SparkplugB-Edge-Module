# SparkplugB Module for IoT Edge

## Overview

The use of SparkPlug B and MQTT is used in the Industrial World; in specific sectors such as Oil & Gas, Energy, and manufacturing. Devices such as PLCs, SCADAS, and Gateways that can transmit telemetry through of MQTT using the SparkPlug B format to obtain different advantages.

In this article, we will briefly introduce SparkPlug B and explain how to implement an IoT Edge module to subscribe to an MQTT broker, process messages in Sparkplug format, and send them to the Azure IoT platform decoded in JSON. Once the data is in IoT Central, we can monitor it in real-time and enable continuous data export to Azure Data Explorer to expand reporting and analytics capabilities with the data.

## What is Sparkplug B?

Sparkplug B is an Open-Source specification designed based on the characteristic features of IoT applications. It helps define topics and message payload that are not specified by standard MQTT and allows non-MQTT terminal devices to transfer data with MQTT Server through Edge of Network.

Sparkplug B helps clients seamlessly integrate data between their sensors, devices or gateways and applications within an MQTT infrastructure and enable interoperability. 

One of the fundamental advantages of using SparkPlug B over MQTT is that bandwidth consumption is reduced by 80-90% in general, allowing solutions to be scaled and hundreds of devices to be connected.

For more information on the Sparkplug B specification, see https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.sparkplug

This article explains how we can deploy an IoT Edge module that is able to connect to the MQTT broker, read the messages in a Sparkplug B format and send them to IoT Central to monitor the messages. In addition, we will show how we export this information to an Azure Data Explorer in order to generate reports and analytics from this data.

## Data Flow

It is frequently to find in an OT environment various devices connected to the industrial network such as Modbus equipment, PLC, OPC US, RTU, Sensors, IoT devices, and others; all this equipment is connected to PLCs or SCADAs, Gateways or Devices that have If MQTT and Sparkplug B are enabled, they will send the telemetry generated by the devices to an MQTT Broker.

What we are going to enable is a Gateway with IoT Edge installed; this can be a VM or a physical device; this solution will provide an MQTT broker based on the Open source Mosquitto; in this document, we will use the MQTT Broker edge module, but there are different options to do it, like installing an MQTT Broker in the OS, but it supposes a double administration.

IoT Edge will collect the data, and through the Sparkplug Decoding Module, it will receive in SparkPlug B format and decode it in a JSON to be able to send it to Azure IoT to be able to store the information, provide visibility and monitoring with the data perform advanced analytics such as efficiency analysis of the operation, alarm analysis, and being able to enable Artificial Intelligence to enable anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, downtime prevention, among others.

## Payload definition

Sparkplug B defines a standard, structured, data-rich but efficient payload format. 

The core payload contains a structured series of key-value pairs defining an array of metrics and associated metadata. The specification defines a variety of optional fields for each metric, such as name, description, datatype, checksum, historical data flag, and many more. Data type indicators accommodate complex types common in industrial applications, like matrices and user-defined types (UDTs). The payload specification also permits an array of custom properties for each metric, such as engineering units or scaling limits, that are published along with the primary process variable or data object. The full payload is then timestamped, sequenced, and encoded using Google protocol buffers (protobufs), an efficient, interoperable, binary representation of the structured data, which maintains a small on-the-wire footprint without sacrificing complexity. When decoded, the payload is typically represented in JavaScript object notation (JSON) but is compatible with many formats. 

Here is an example of a simple spBv1.0 payload decoded into JSON: 

`*{ "timestamp": 1486144502122,*` 

`*"metrics":*`

`*[{*`

`*"name": "My Metric",*` 

`*"alias": 1,*` 

`*"timestamp": 1479123452194,*` 

`*"dataType": "String",*` 

`*"value": "Test"*` 

`*}], "seq": 2 }*`

# Solution implementation 

In the next section, we will prepare, configure and deploy the complete solution. It is assumed that certain parts, such as preparing the Linux and creating the IoT Central app, are ready, given other articles explaining the step-by-step process.

## MQTT Broker Edge Module

### Description

Typically, when there is MQTT messaging, brokers installed in the operating system are used, the problem is that there is double administration, on the one hand, the IoT Edge runtime and its modules, and at the operating system level, the MQTT broker Edge Module, an MQTT broker has been created experimentally based on Mosquitto to be implemented at the Azure IoT Edge runtime.

### Configuration

 The module configuration will be done through Create Options of the module, so the communication port must be configured, by default is using port 1883, and the service configuration is through the mosquito.conf file

`"createOptions": "{\"Hostname\":\"mosquitto\",\"Cmd\":[\"/usr/sbin/mosquitto\",\"-c\",\"/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf\"],\"HostConfig\":{\"PortBindings\":{\"1883/tcp\":[{\"HostPort\":\"1883\"}]}}}"`

Once the solution is implemented, its operation can be verified by performing a telnet command to the device's hostname with the configured port.

`telnet myserver 1883`

Other tests that can be done are with an MQTT client to verify communication and the configuration.

### Routing

This module has no logic attached to the routing input or output.

## Sparkplug B Module

### Description

This module will be in charge of connecting with the MQTT Edge module through the defined port; it will subscribe to the specified topics, and the module can transform from Sparkplug to Json in plain text.

## Configuration

The module expects the following configurations

|            |                                                              |                                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ip**     | Hostname or IP of the server where the IoT Edge is  installed | myserver                                                 |
| **topics** | List of topics to subscribe. If you want to subscribe all leave  # | "spBv1.0/YOUR_DEVICES/DDATA/YOUR_DEVICE_OR_#_FOR_COMODIN |

 

## Prepare the manifest for IoT Central

Configure Device Module. When the IoT Edge runtime connects to your IoT Central application, it downloads the deployment manifest. The runtime uses the information in the deployment manifest to determine which modules to install and how to configure them. Modules download from a container registry such as Azure Container Registry. 

The deployment manifest you used installs the two required system modules, edgeAgent and edgeHub, and two custom modules SparkPlugB and MQTT edge module. This custom module sends ambient and machine telemetry to IoT Central and has the following properties, that an operator can use to configure the module:

1. Take the “manifest_iotcentral.json” 

2. Update the ACR credentials 

![Text  Description automatically generated](/assets/images/clip_image010.png)

 

3. Adjust the “econfig” section:

Ip or dns server of mqtt: **for testing use** TEST.MOSQUITTO.ORG

Topics: **for testing use** spBv1.0/SparkplugDevices/DDATA/JsonScada/DemoVPS

Tip: remember that can use willcard with #: **for testing use** spBv1.0/SparkplugDevices/DDATA/#

For better understanding of the configuration think in this json format

  `{    "ip": "<myserver>",    "topics":[      "spBv1.0/SparkplugDevices/DDATA/JsonScada/DemoVPS",       "spBv1.0/SparkplugDevices/DDATA/JsonScada/DemoVPS2"    ]  }`  

Finally, to insert the variable into the manifest replace '' with '' \, all within double quotes

`"{\"ip\":\"MQTT_DNS_OR_IP\",\"topics\":[\"spBv1.0/ADD_ESPECIFIC_TOPICS_N1\",\"spBv1.0/spBv1.0/ADD_ESPECIFIC_TOPICS_N2\"]}"`
